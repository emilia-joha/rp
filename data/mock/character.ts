Far... Meeting more creatures, giving gifts so they will like me... They chase me. Forced to steal to survive, hiding from evil creatures. If they see me, they hunt me. \n\nUntil... Lost. Alone. Caught. \n\nThe evil creatures found me, followed me to where I went fishing, caught me, tied me up, and threw me into the waters, and I sunk... Deep. Darkening. \n\nA voice...?
